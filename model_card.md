# Model Card: GLiNER Zero-Shot Named Entity Recognition

## Model Details

- **Model Name**: GLiNER (medium-v2.1)
- **Model Type**: Zero-shot Named Entity Recognition
- **Version**: 2.1
- **Architecture**: Bidirectional Transformer Encoder (BERT-like)
- **Checkpoint**: `urchade/gliner_medium-v2.1`
- **Repository**: [Hugging Face - urchade/gliner_medium-v2.1](https://huggingface.co/urchade/gliner_medium-v2.1)
- **License**: [Apache 2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)

## Model Description

GLiNER is a Named Entity Recognition (NER) model capable of identifying any entity type using a bidirectional transformer encoder (BERT-like). It provides a practical alternative to traditional NER models, which are limited to predefined entities. GLiNER can recognize entities that it wasn't explicitly trained on, making it highly flexible for various NER applications.

### Key Features

- **Zero-shot Learning**: Can recognize entity types not seen during training
- **Flexibility**: Works with any user-defined entity type
- **Strong Performance**: Competitive with supervised models on standard benchmarks
- **Multilingual Capabilities**: Supports multiple languages based on the underlying transformer model

## Performance Metrics

The model has been evaluated on standard NER benchmarks:

| Dataset | Precision | Recall | F1 Score |
|---------|-----------|--------|----------|
| CoNLL-2003 (English) | 0.91 | 0.89 | 0.90 |
| OntoNotes 5.0 | 0.87 | 0.85 | 0.86 |
| Custom Zero-shot Tasks | 0.83 | 0.79 | 0.81 |

## Intended Use

The GLiNER model is intended to be used for:

- Extracting named entities from text documents
- Information extraction and knowledge graph construction
- Document analysis and content enrichment
- Preprocessing for downstream NLP tasks

## Limitations

- **Context Length**: Limited by the maximum sequence length of the underlying transformer model (typically 512 tokens)
- **Rare Entity Types**: May have lower performance on very specialized or domain-specific entities
- **Computational Requirements**: Requires more resources than traditional rule-based or simple ML approaches to NER
- **Novel Formats**: May struggle with unusual text formats or heavily abbreviated content

## Ethical Considerations

- **Bias**: The model may inherit biases present in its training data, potentially affecting entity recognition across different demographic groups
- **Privacy**: NER systems can potentially extract personally identifiable information (PII) which should be handled with appropriate privacy controls
- **Misuse**: Could be used to extract information from documents in ways not intended by their authors

## Implementation Details

### Hardware Requirements

- **Minimum**: 4GB RAM, CPU with AVX2 support
- **Recommended**: 8GB+ RAM, GPU with 4GB+ VRAM for production use
- **Optimal**: 16GB+ RAM, GPU with 8GB+ VRAM for batch processing

### Software Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch 1.10+
- Transformers 4.20+
- CUDA 11.6+ (for GPU acceleration)

### Inference Time

- **CPU (Intel Xeon)**: ~200-300ms per inference
- **GPU (NVIDIA T4)**: ~20-40ms per inference
- **GPU (NVIDIA A100)**: ~5-10ms per inference

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage

```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForTokenClassification

# Load model and tokenizer
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("urchade/gliner_medium-v2.1")
model = AutoModelForTokenClassification.from_pretrained("urchade/gliner_medium-v2.1")

# Example text and entity type
text = "Apple Inc. was founded by Steve Jobs in California."
entity_type = "PERSON"

# Prepare input
inputs = tokenizer(f"Find {entity_type} in: {text}", return_tensors="pt")

# Run inference
outputs = model(**inputs)

# Process outputs to extract entities
# (Implementation depends on how GLiNER processes and returns results)
```

### Integration with REST API

The model can be deployed as a REST API service. Example request:

```json
POST /api/v1/predict
{
  "text": "Apple Inc. was founded by Steve Jobs in California.",
  "entity_type": "PERSON"
}
```

Example response:

```json
{
  "entities": [
    {
      "text": "Steve Jobs",
      "start": 27,
      "end": 37,
      "entity_type": "PERSON",
      "score": 0.97
    }
  ],
  "processing_time": 0.035
}
```

## Model Governance

### Monitoring

The deployed model should be monitored for:

- **Performance Drift**: Changes in precision, recall, or latency
- **Data Drift**: Significant changes in input distributions
- **Resource Usage**: Memory, CPU/GPU utilization, and throughput
- **Error Rates**: Frequency and types of inference failures

### Updating

- Regular evaluation on benchmark datasets to compare with newer models
- Periodic retraining or fine-tuning based on performance metrics
- Version control of model artifacts with clear performance change documentation

### Security

- Input validation to prevent injection attacks
- Rate limiting to prevent DoS attacks
- Access controls on model endpoints
- Regular vulnerability scanning of dependencies
